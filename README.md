# Structure-aware completion of images in urban road environment.

This code is based on https://github.com/jbhuang0604/StructCompletion which is the re-implementation of the paper, *Huang, J.B, Kang, S.B., Ahuja, N., Kopf, J., 2014. Image completion using planar structure guidance. ACM Transactions on graphics (TOG) 33, 1-10*.

Mask images can be generated by deleting the pixels of ROI in a image.

You can modify the **imgFileName** in **run.m** to specify the input mask image and then run **run.m** to get result. Besides, you can adjust parameters in **sc_init_opt.m**.

The completed results are saved in the result folder.
